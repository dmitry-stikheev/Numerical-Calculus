Final goal: price european stock options with the Dupire Local Volatility Model.


Remaining steps:

Block 1:
1) Extend existing EuropeanOption class functionality to incorporate the optionality of finding either the price given IV, or IV given the price.
(the latter to be deployed as a next step)

2) Write an IV class which will take an instance of the EuropeanOption class with price as an attribute and apply the inverse BS
formula to extract the IV. (perhaps implemented as an EuropeanOption class method)

3) Write interpolators (both linear and cubic_spline-based) to cunstruct the IV surface.

4) Code the simplest Dupire Local Volatility model (without any sorts of regularization and tackling any kinds of surface ill-posed problems)

Block 2:
1) Incorporate the Tikhonov-type regularization for spline interpolation for the purposes of Local IV surface structure consistency.
(issues posed by the recalibration process)

2) Extend the volatility models framework by adding either:
    a) Heston Stochastic Volatility Model or
    b) SABR (Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho) to enrich the library.
